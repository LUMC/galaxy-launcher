### Examples for dictionary variables
```YAML
galaxy_docker_backup_database_cron_jobs:  
  daily: # The key is the "name" of the cron job  
    description: "Description of the cron job"  
    timestamp: "-%Z%Y%m%dT%H%M%S" # Timestamp uses the "date" function. Check date --help on how to use the timestamp  
    filename: "galaxy-hourly-backup" # Archives are stored as filename.timestamp.gz  
    files_to_keep: 7 # How many backups of this job should be kept. Since this jobs runs daily, one week of backups is kept  
    compression_level: 6 # Compression uses gzip. 6 is the default level.Level should be 1-9  
    cron: # This is a dictionary that uses the same values as the ansible cron module(http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/cron_module.html)   
      special_time: "daily"  
  two_weekly_example:  
    description: "Two-weekly backup of the galaxy database"  
    timestamp: "-%Z%Y%m%dT%H%M"  
    filename: "galaxy-fortnight-backup"  
    files_to_keep: 6  
    compression_level: 6  
    cron:
      month: *
      day: 1,15
      hour: 3
```
```YAML
rsync_settings:  
  dest: "/destination/path/on/remote/host"   
  host: "example.host.org"
  user: "user" # The user that is connected to. This key can be ommited
  delete: True # Remove backups on the remote server if they are removed on the galaxy server. True is recommended.
  compression_level: 0 # Can range from 0-9. Rsync compresses the data before transmission to save bandwith*
  cron:  How often the rsync to the remote host should be performed. Hourly is recommended.
    special_time: hourly

 #* 0 is recommended because the archives are already compressed

```

```YAML
galaxy_docker_ldap_settings:
  server: "ldap://dc1.example.com"
  search_base: "dc=dc1,dc=example,dc=com"
  search_user: "ldapsearch"
  search_password: "supersecret" #ldapsearch's password
  login_use_username: False
  email_suffix: "@example.com"
```
